<strong>Description:</strong>
Create a new React project: new file and new folder

Use bootstrap and install bootstrap

Create a simple React component called Counter that displays a number and two buttons - one for incrementing the number and one for decrementing it. The initial number should be 0.

Requirements:

The component should display the current number.
There should be a button labeled "+" that, when clicked, increments the number by 1.
There should be a button labeled "-" that, when clicked, decrements the number by 1. The number should not go below 0.
Add a reset button that resets the counter to 0.
Style the component to make it visually appealing.

Hints:

Use state to keep track of the current number.
Implement event handlers for the buttons to update the state accordingly.
Use Bootstrap for styling.
This mini challenge will help you practice setting up a React component, managing state, handling user events, and applying basic styling. Once you've completed this challenge, you'll have gained valuable experience that will prepare you for building the todo list application.
